If this is true, the loop continues (indefinitely) - but as soon as this statement is no longer true, the loop will stop. The above loop is an infinity loop and will never stop running. This is because the value of \"i\" is always going to be 1 - which is always going to be less than 6, which means the conditional statement will never be untrue. We can modify our code so that this is not an infinity loop by adding a statement that adds \"1\" to the value of \"i\" after each successful loop. \n",

    "1. Check the conditional statement for truth (is i less than 6?); if yes, continue to the first statement underneath; if no, end the loop. \n",
    "2. The starting value of \"i\" is 1, therefore, the conditional statement is true. We can continue with the first statement listed underneath the conditional statement. \n",
    "3. We print the value of \"i\" because that is the first item listed underneath the conditional statement. On the first iteration of the loop, this means we are printing the value \"1\". \n",
    "4. We continue executing the statements underneath the conditional statement in the order they are listed. The next statement is i = i + 1 (this can also be written as i += 1); this means we are going to take whatever the value of \"i\" is and add 1 to it. Then we are going to save that result as the new value of \"i\". This is going to happen at the end of each successful loop. At the end of the first loop, \"i\" will have a value of \"2\". \n",
    "5. We've reached the end of our listed statements under the conditional statement, now it is time to go back to the top of the list and try everything again for iteration #2. \n",
    "6. Start again at the conditional statement - at the beginning of each iteration, the conditional statement is re-checked for truth. If it is still true, we cycle through the listed statements again (print the value of \"i\" and add 1 to the current value of \"i\"). \n",

Each pair is called an <b>item</b>, and each item contains a <b>key</b> and a <b>value</b>. The key is separated by a value with a \" : \" and each item within the dictionary is separated by a comma. The entire dictionary is contained within curly brackets ( {} ). See below for an example:\n",
